### Object Interaction

* `User` owns a `Cart`, can add/remove books, and place `Orders`.
* `Cart` holds multiple `Books` and calculates prices.
* `Book` ensures it canâ€™t be in more than one cart.
* `Order` is created when the cart is placed, and it records the books and price.

---

### Encapsulation Principles

* Internal state is private by convention.
* Only class methods modify key properties.
* Unique IDs help track objects without conflict.
* Book availability prevents shared state issues between carts.
